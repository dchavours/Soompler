# Building

Ð¡urrent build instruction based on ElementaryOS 5.0 bui I think it will be compatible with Ubuntu 18.10 and many more Linux distributions.

1. Obtain free JUCE Framework from official web-site. https://shop.juce.com/get-juce
2. Open Projucer from downloaded JUCE framework.
3. Open soompler.jucer project file in Projucer
4. Edit global paths in Projucer (location of framework directories, VST2, VST3, and other sdk's location if you want to build specific plugin types)
5. Select desired exporter or add for your system. 
6. Click on LinuxMake exported, right click and choose "Save this exporter"
7. Do the same as 5 with CLion exporter, if you want to open it in CLion or QtCreator
8. Open project in desired IDE
